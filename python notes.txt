Python is a high level programming language.
Pyhton is also known as scripting language.



math operators in python:
    1. +        = used for addition of two numbers (2+2)
    2. -        = used for substraction of two numbers (5-2)
    3. *        = used for multiplication of two numbers (2*2)
    4. **       = used for the exponent or power (3**2) first is the normal integer and second is the power.
    5. /        = used for division of two numbers (10/2) it always returns the value in decimal or float.
    6. //       = it is also used for division (10//2) it always prints out the whole number or integer. it always cirulate with the lower number.
    7. %        = module (22%8) it gives us the remainder of the division performed.
    
    sequence by which the operators are performed in python:
        **,*,/,//,%,-,+
    
string:
    string concatenation: "string1" + "string2"
    string concatenation: "string1" + variable_name_containing_string
    string concatenation: variable_name_containing_string + variable_name_containing_string
    

variables:
    rules for variable declaration:
        1. You can't use the name for the variable which is already a python keyword like print, for, etc.
        2. Variable name can be started with _ but it cannot start with the number, special characters.
        
        
variable type conversion:
    str(variable_name)                      (this will convert variable to string)
    int(variable_name)                      (this will convert variable to integer)
    float(variable_name)                    (this will convert vaiable to float)
    like this we can convert different types of variables.
    
    ** we can check the variable type by type(variable_name) function**
    
lenth funnction:
    len(variable_name)                      (it will give us the length of the variable means how much characters are there in the string or list)
    
    
    
true or false:
    wording for true and false:
        True                                (it will tell if the condition or expression you specified is true)
        False                               (it will tell if the condition or expression you specified is flase)

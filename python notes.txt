    2. -        = used for substraction of two numbers (5-2)
    3. *        = used for multiplication of two numbers (2*2)
    4. **       = used for the exponent or power (3**2) first is the normal integer and second is the power.
    5. /        = used for division of two numbers (10/2) it always returns the value in decimal or float.
    6. //       = it is also used for division (10//2) it always prints out the whole number or integer. it always cirulate with the lower number.
    7. %        = module (22%8) it gives us the remainder of the division performed.
    
    sequence by which the operators are performed in python:

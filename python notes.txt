Python is a high level programming language.
Pyhton is also known as scripting language.



math operators in python:
    1. +        = used for addition of two numbers (2+2)
    2. -        = used for substraction of two numbers (5-2)
    3. *        = used for multiplication of two numbers (2*2)
    4. **       = used for the exponent or power (3**2) first is the normal integer and second is the power.
    5. /        = used for division of two numbers (10/2) it always returns the value in decimal or float.
    6. //       = it is also used for division (10//2) it always prints out the whole number or integer. it always cirulate with the lower number.
    7. %        = module (22%8) it gives us the remainder of the division performed.
    
    sequence by which the operators are performed in python:
        **,*,/,//,%,-,+
    
string:
    string concatenation: "string1" + "string2"
    string concatenation: "string1" + variable_name_containing_string
    string concatenation: variable_name_containing_string + variable_name_containing_string
    

variables:
    rules for variable declaration:
        1. You can't use the name for the variable which is already a python keyword like print, for, etc.
        2. Variable name can be started with _ but it cannot start with the number, special characters.
        
        
variable type conversion:
    str(variable_name)                      (this will convert variable to string)
    int(variable_name)                      (this will convert variable to integer)
    float(variable_name)                    (this will convert vaiable to float)
    like this we can convert different types of variables.
    
    ** we can check the variable type by type(variable_name) function**
    
lenth funnction:
    len(variable_name)                      (it will give us the length of the variable means how much characters are there in the string or list)
    
    
    
true or false:
    wording for true and false:
        True                                (it will tell if the condition or expression you specified is true)
        False                               (it will tell if the condition or expression you specified is flase)
    


If statement:
    syntax:
        if expression1 == expression2:
            do something
        else:
            do something

            
while loops:
    syntax:
        while condition:
            do something
    while loop is a loop in which if the condition given to the loop does not get specified then it will run endlessly or infinite loop and if the condition specified is correct then it will break out of the loop.
    while loops can also be a infinite loop by using following syntax:
        while true:
            do something
    
    continue statement:
        it is a keyword in python in which if we use that then when the program comes to that line in which continue is specified then it will go to to starting of the program but it will not let the program break the loop.
        
        

for loop:
    syntax:
        for variable_name in range(starting_number, ending_number,interval):
            do something
    for loop is a loop in which the loop automatically increments itself by the specified interval.
    
    
    
libraries:
    syntax:
        import library_name
    library function is used to access different libraries availiable in python.
    os library:
        it is the system library in which you can do things based on system.
    subprocess library:
        it is like the os library which deals with terminal or command prompt.
    random library:
        It is the library to create random numbers or random things.
